## 🌏 **Understanding Weather Trends & Social Impacts in Singapore**

Climate change is reshaping weather patterns worldwide, and Singapore, as a tropical nation, is experiencing increasing temperatures, fluctuating rainfall, and extreme weather events. These changes particularly affect vulnerable populations, including **low-income families and elderly residents**, who may struggle to adapt to rising heat and changing rainfall patterns.

This project provides an **interactive Shiny Dashboard** designed to **visualize, analyze, and forecast** Singapore's climate trends using real-world data from **Meteorological Service Singapore (2020-2025)**. Our tool integrates **weather station data** with **demographic insights from the 2020 Singapore Census** to explore the relationships between weather conditions and social impact.

## **🌟 Key Features of Our Dashboard**

✔ **Interactive Visualizations** – Explore historical trends in temperature, rainfall, and wind speed.\

✔ **Comparative Analysis** – Understand weather differences across **10 AWS stations**.\

✔ **Geospatial Mapping** – Overlay weather data with **socioeconomic factors** such as income and age distribution.\

✔ **Statistical Testing** – Validate whether weather patterns significantly differ across regions.\

✔ **Time Series Forecasting** – Predict future climate trends using **ARIMA, STL, and ETS models**.

By offering these insights, our project aims to help **researchers, policymakers, and the public** make informed decisions about Singapore's climate resilience strategies. 🌿
