# Exploratory Analysis: Ridge Plot

The **Ridge Plot** module lets you compare the monthly distribution of a selected weather variable across multiple stations using visually appealing ridgeline plots. It's a great way to spot seasonal trends and variations across different locations.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2015.51.24.png)

### How to Use This Module (Step-by-Step)

1.  **Choose a Variable**

2.  **Select Stations**\
    You can only select up to **4 weather stations** at once. This limit is intentionally set to keep the plot clear and readable.

    -   If you select more than 4 stations, a warning will appear prompting you to reduce the number of selections.

        ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2017.54.26-01.png)

3.  **Set Time Resolution**

    -   Monthly (default, y-axis is explicitly labeled with months to compare seasonal distributions)

4.  **Choose a Date Range**

5.  **Click ‚ÄúUpdate View‚Äù**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Summary Statistics**

-   Click the **right tab** : - A clean table summarizes key statistics by station, including:

    \- Minimum,Quartiles,Median,Mean,Maximum![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2015.52.45%20copy.png)

You can toggle between these two tabs any time to switch between visual and numeric summaries.

### Why Limit to 4 Stations?

Including too many stations on one ridgeline plot can make it hard to read. To ensure visual clarity and keep the plot user-friendly, we‚Äôve limited the selection to **a maximum of 4 stations** at once. This helps users focus on meaningful comparisons without overwhelming the display.

# Exploratory Analysis: Geofacet

The **Geofacet** module is designed to help you compare weather trends across multiple stations in Singapore, using small multiples arranged by geography. It provides two tabs ‚Äî one to view **all stations** at once, and another to focus on **a selected subset**.

## Time Series Analysis: STL Decomposition

The **STL Decomposition** module helps you break down a time series into three components ‚Äî **Trend**, **Seasonal**, and **Remainder** ‚Äî so you can better understand long-term and seasonal behaviors in your weather data.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2015.59.42.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Use This Module (Step-by-Step)

**1. Select Variable**

**2. Select Station**

Pick a single station (e.g., Clementi) to focus the decomposition on.

**3. Set Time Resolution**

**4. Choose Date Range**

**5. After setting everything, hit "Run Model"**

### 

#### STL Decomposition Plot (Top Right)

This shows how your time series breaks down into:

\- **Trend**: Long-term movement of the variable

\- **Seasonal**: Repeating seasonal patterns (e.g., annual temperature cycle)

\- **Remainder**: What‚Äôs left over after removing trend and seasonality.

You‚Äôll see these three components stacked clearly over time.

#### Cycle Plot by Month (Bottom Right)

This plot shows the seasonal pattern by month: - Each panel (Jan‚ÄìDec) shows how the variable fluctuates in that month across years. - Helps you identify **which months are consistently higher or lower** than the average. - The **blue line** in each panel represents the monthly average baseline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üí° Tip

If you're not sure what STL means, click the **‚ÄúAbout STL Decomposition‚Äù** panel ‚Äî it gives a friendly explanation of each component!

# Time Series Analysis: Correlograms

The **Correlogram Analysis** module helps you explore autocorrelation structures in your time series data. It provides tools to assess whether your series has trend or seasonality, and whether differencing is needed for modeling.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2018.43.27.png)

### How to Use This Module (Step-by-Step)

**1. Select Variable**

**2. Select Station**

**3. Set Time Resolution**

**4. Choose Date Range**

**5. Choose Plot Type**

Select one of the three plot styles to focus on:

\- `partial` shows **PACF & ACF** (default)

\- `scatter` shows **lag scatter plots** (for visual correlation)

\- `histogram` shows the **distribution** of observed values

**6. Adjust Maximum Lag**

Use the slider to set how far into the past the autocorrelation should be checked (e.g., 24 months).

**7. After setting everything, hit "** **Run Analysis"**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What You‚Äôll See

-   **Time Series Line Plot** of the selected variable\
-   **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)** ‚Äì measures how current values relate to past ones\
-   **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation)** ‚Äì filters out indirect effects from intermediate lags

<!-- -->

-   A differenced time series that removes trend (using lag = 1)\

-   Corresponding ACF/PACF plots show whether autocorrelation is reduced\

-   Helps decide whether trend differencing is necessary

-   A second round of differencing, targeting **seasonality**\

-   Usually done at lag = 12 (for monthly data)\

-   Final ACF/PACF plots help check if the series is now close to white noise

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tips

-   Use this module before model training to **diagnose time series structure**
-   If strong spikes appear in ACF/PACF, differencing may be required
-   Blue dashed lines = significance threshold. Bars that exceed them are statistically significant

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### More Info?

If you want to understand ACF/PACF better, open the **About Correlogram Analysis** panel at the top ‚Äî it has a quick explanation.
