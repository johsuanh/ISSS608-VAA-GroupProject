# 1 Motivation

In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events worldwide has raised concerns about similar trends emerging in Singapore. As a densely populated tropical city-state, Singapore may be particularly vulnerable to shifts in temperature, rainfall intensity, and other climate related changes.

To investigate these patterns, we are developing an interactive R Shiny dashboard that enables exploratory data analysis (EDA) and forecasting based on historical weather data from 9 AWS stations across Singapore. Through intuitive visualizations and modeling, the Shiny App dashborard empowers users to explore local weather trends and gain insights into Singapore’s evolving climate.

# ⁠2 Objective

The objectives of this proposal are to:

-   Implement EDA tools to observe weather patterns across 9 AWS stations, featuring multiple temporal resolutions and visualization techniques

-   Design and integrate time-series analysis and forecasting models  to predict weather trends

-   Develop an interactive dashboard that simplifies complex weather data for public exploration and understanding

# 3 Data

The [historical weather data](https://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) from Meteorological Service Singapore will be used for analysis. We will collect data from the following 9 AWS stations across Singapore between January 2019 and January 2025:

|                     |                   |                     |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Weather Station** | **Planning Area** | **Planning Region** |
| Changi              | Changi            | East Region         |
| Paya Lebar          | Paya Lebar        | East Region         |
| Newton              | Newton            | Central Region      |
| Tai Seng            | Geylang           | North-East Region   |
| Ang Mo Kio          | Ang Mo Kio        | North-East Region   |
| Admiralty           | Woodlands         | North Region        |
| Pasir Panjang       | Queenstown        | West Region         |
| Clementi            | Clementi          | West Region         |
| Jurong West         | Jurong West       | West Region         |

# 4 Methodology

There will be three main components in our Shiny App: 

## 4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Through an interactive Shiny App visualization, users can analyze weather patterns and explore relationships between weather factors and geographical features.

The following visualization methods will be used in our exploratory data analysis:

-   **Line Chart:** Visualize daily, weekly, and monthly weather trends by station over time.

    -   **Seasonal Monsoon Patterns:** Highlight the Northeast Monsoon (Dec–Mar) and Southwest Monsoon (Jun–Sep) periods using distinct colors, allowing users to observe seasonal weather differences influenced by the monsoons.

-   **Ridge Plot + Box Plot:** Show the distribution of monthly weather variations by station. The users can observe weather difference of stations and cross stations directly.

-   **Geofacet:** Display a line chart of weather data based on station coordinates, allowing users to observe how different locations may influence weather patterns.

<!-- -->

-   **Isohyet Map:** Visualize weather patterns using the **`tmap`** and **`gstat`** packages to create an Isohyet map through spatial interpolation. This tab allows users to apply two interpolation methods (IDW and Ordinary Kriging) to generate the map.

## 4.2 Time Series Analysis  

This section allows users to analyze weather data through **STL decomposition** and **correlograms**, helping them gain deeper insights into underlying patterns and structures in the data.

### Time Series Decomposition

-   **STL Decomposition**: Separates the time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder components.
-   **Cycle Plot**: Highlights recurring seasonal patterns across different periods.

### Correlograms

-   **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)**:\
    Measures the correlation between the time series and its own lagged values. It helps identify the presence of repeating patterns or seasonality and can indicate whether differencing is needed to achieve stationarity.

-   **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)**:\
    Shows the correlation between the time series and its lagged values after removing the effects of shorter lags. It is especially useful for determining the appropriate number of lags in autoregressive (AR) models.

-   **Differencing Analysis**:\
    Includes both **trend differencing** (removing long-term trends) and **seasonal differencing** (removing seasonal effects) to help transform the time series into a stationary format, which is often required for effective forecasting using models like ARIMA.

## 4.3 Univariate Forecasting

This section allows users to select a variable of interest for time series forecasting. We provide a variety of models, including:

-   **ETS-ANN**: Simple Exponential Smoothing

-   **ETS-AAN**: Holt’s Linear Trend

-   **ETS-AAA**: Holt-Winters Additive

-   **ETS-MMM**: Holt-Winters Multiplicative

-   **ETS-MAM**: Multiplicative Holt-Winters with Additive Trend

-   **ETS-MMN**: Multiplicative Trend Exponential Smoothing

-   **Auto ARIMA**

-   **Auto ETS**

### Model Training

The train-test split is set at 80% vs 20%. This tab allows users to select, train, test, and evaluate models using metrics such as AIC, BIC, and RMSE. Residual plots are also provided to help assess model performance and adequacy.

### Model Forecasting

After reviewing model training performance, users can select their preferred models for forecasting. The selected models will generate future predictions, and key model parameters will be displayed for reference.
