# 1 Motivation

Climate change poses significant challenges for Singapore's urban environment and infrastructure. As a densely populated tropical country, Singapore faces particular vulnerability to rising temperatures, extreme rainfall, and changing weather patterns. These climate-related risks affect not just daily life, but also impact urban planning, public health, and economic activities.

To address this challenge, our team will develop an interactive analytics dashboard using R Shiny App to transform complex weather data into actionable insights. Through analysis of historical and real-time data from 10 AWS stations across Singapore, we aim to create a platform that helps the public better understand and respond to Singapore's changing climate conditions through intuitive visualizations and forecasting models.

# ⁠2 Objective

The objectives of this proposal are to:

-   Create an interactive dashboard that transforms complex weather data into accessible insights for public understanding

-   Implement comparative analysis tools to evaluate weather patterns across 10 AWS stations, featuring multiple temporal resolutions and visualization techniques

-   Design and integrate multi-horizon forecasting models (daily/weekly/monthly) to predict weather trends

# 3 Data

The [historical weather data](https://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) from Meteorological Service Singapore will be used for analysis. We will collect data from the following 10 AWS stations across Singapore between January 2020 and January 2025:

|                     |                   |                     |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Weather Station** | **Planning Area** | **Planning Region** |
| Changi              | Changi            | East Region         |
| Paya Lebar          | Paya Lebar        | East Region         |
| Marina Barrage      | Marina South      | Central Region      |
| Newton              | Newton            | Central Region      |
| Tai Seng            | Geylang           | North-East Region   |
| Ang Mo Kio          | Ang Mo Kio        | North-East Region   |
| Admiralty           | Woodlands         | North Region        |
| Pasir Panjang       | Queenstown        | West Region         |
| Clementi            | Clementi          | West Region         |
| Jurong West         | Jurong West       | West Region         |

# 4 Methodology

There will be three main components in our Shiny App: 

## 4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Through an interactive Shiny App visualization, users can analyze patterns and explore relationships between temporal data, rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and geographical features.

The following visualization methods will be used in our exploratory data analysis:

#### **Time Series Analysis**  

-   **Line Chart:** Visualize daily, weekly, and monthly weather trends by station over time.

    -   **Seasonal Monsoon Patterns:** Highlight monsoon periods Northeast Monsoon (Dec–Mar), Southwest Monsoon (Jun–Sep) and Inter-monsoon (Apr–May, Oct–Nov) with different color, letting user observe weather differences across stations.

-   **Ridge Plot:** Show the distribution of daily, weekly, and monthly weather variations by station.

-   **Geofacet:** Display weather data with station layouts reflecting their geographical positions. Use faceted line charts (for temperature) and histograms (for rainfall) to highlight seasonal variations.

#### **Geospatial Analysis**

-   **Isohyet Map:** Visualize weather patterns using isolines overlaid on station data with `tmap`, showing spatial gradients.

## 4.2 Co-variation Analysis

After EDA, user can apply the following statistical tests to confirm whether rainfall, wind speed and temperature exhibit correlation with each other:

-   **Cross-Correlation Function:** Measures how two time series are correlated at different time lags. Helps identify lead-lag relationships, like "does a drop in temperature precede heavy rainfall?"

-   **Cointegration Analysis:** Tests if two time series move together in the long run despite short-term fluctuations, using the `urca` package.

## 4.3 Forecasting

#### **Plots**

-   **ACF & PCF plots :** help users understand the autocorrelation in time series data and identify which lags might be useful for forecasting model. 
-   **STL plots:** help decompose the time series into its seasonal, trend, and remainder components, providing insight into the structure of the data. 

#### **Forecasting Models**

-   **ARIMA Models:**  
    -   **Auto ARIMA:** when there is a mix of trend and seasonal patterns with autocorrelation, user can use auto ARIMA, which automatically selects the best parameters (AR, I, MA) based on the data 
    -   **STL ARIMA:** when there are complex seasonality or non-linear trends in the data, user can choose this model for weather forecasting
-   **ETS Models:**  
    -   **Auto ETS:** user can choose this model if the data shows clear, stable trends or seasonal patterns with little noise
